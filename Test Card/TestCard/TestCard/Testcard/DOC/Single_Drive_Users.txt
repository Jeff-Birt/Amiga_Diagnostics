                Creating a Bootable Workbench 1.3 Floppy Disk.
                ----------------------------------------------

  1) Copy a Workbench disk using "Duplicate" from the pull down menu.
  2) Delete all of the files NOT shown in the "Listing" below.
  3) Unarchive the TestCard.lha file to ram:t directory.
  4) From the CLI type "Copy all ram:t to df0:" without the quotes, where
     df0: is the drive containing your copy of the Workbench disk.
  5) Rename the disk to "TESTCARD" without the quotes.
  6) NOTE:- this disk will boot up on Kickstart 2.0x to Kickstart 3.0x.

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
